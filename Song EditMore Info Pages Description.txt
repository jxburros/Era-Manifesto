4. Behavioral Summary for AI

This final section concisely instructs the AI how the Song Edit Page must function:

All Song fields and modules must follow the order and structure given here.

Video checkboxes dynamically create/delete Video Items.

Instruments automatically create/delete Recording Tasks.

Versions must be collapsible list entries with expandable details.

The Core Version must be display-only and reflect Song Information.

All Tasks must use the global Task system.

The Song Task Edit Page is a specialized version of the global Task Edit layout.

No custom UI flows, modals, or behaviors beyond what is described.
