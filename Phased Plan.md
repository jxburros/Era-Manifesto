Music Tracker App — Phased Implementation Plan
(Covers all requested changes to Videos, Events, Releases, Expenses, and Global Tasks)
PHASE 0 — FOUNDATION & PREP

Before making individual feature changes, the following system-level updates must occur:

0.1 Ensure the Unified Task Architecture is fully functional

All Items (Songs, Videos, Events, Releases, Expenses, Global Tasks) must:

Use the same Task model

Use the same Task Edit/More Info Page (specialized where needed)

Use the same Add Task logic

Support AutoTasks + Custom Tasks in the same module

0.2 Ensure Stage / Era / Tags fields exist at Item & Task levels

All Item pages will need these.

0.3 Ensure Item Linking System exists

Needed for:

Videos linked to Songs/Versions/Events/Releases

Events linked to Items

Releases linking Tracks to Songs/Versions

Expenses linking to Team Members

PHASE 1 — VIDEO SYSTEM OVERHAUL
1.1 Video Type Behavior

Videos can only have one Type.

If the user selects multiple Types on a Song/Version, system generates multiple Video Items (one per Type).

Autogenerated Videos:

Type field = Display Only

Cannot be changed after creation

1.2 Attaching Videos to Songs/Versions as Standalones

When user creates a standalone Video, they must pick a Type first.

After attaching a Song/Version:

Type becomes Display Only

Song/Version video checkbox auto-checks

1.3 Attaching Other Items to a Video

Videos should allow attaching:

Releases

Events
(For tracking only, no extra logic needed.)

1.4 Timed Exclusive Rework

Timed Exclusive = YES/NO
If YES → show:

Start Date

End Date

Exclusive Notes (usually platform)

1.5 Cost Cleanup + Budget

Remove: Estimated Cost, Quoted Cost, Paid Cost from the Video page.

Add new field:

Budgeted Cost

If Total Estimated Cost from Tasks > Budgeted Cost
→ Show “Over Budget” flag

1.6 Stage/Era/Tags for Videos

Add these fields directly to Video Information module.

1.7 Fix Add Task Button for Videos

Must open the Video Task More/Edit Info Page

Uses unified Task system

Must include: Stage/Era/Tags, Notes, Team Members, Cost fields, Status

1.8 Autogenerated Video Tasks

Creating a Video (manually or auto) must generate:

Plan Video

Hire Crew

Film Video

Edit Video

Submit Video

Release Video

PHASE 2 — EVENTS SYSTEM OVERHAUL
2.1 Attendees

Add simple short-form list:

Name-only text entries

No functional logic (for now)

2.2 Remove Incorrect Fields

Remove:

Exclusive Type

Exclusive Description

Estimated/Quoted/Paid Cost fields

Events derive cost from Tasks only.

2.3 Stage/Era/Tags

Add these fields to Events.

2.4 Map Button

Next to Location:

Provide a button “Open in Maps”

Opens location in user’s chosen mapping provider (Google Maps as fallback)

2.5 Item Linking

Events may connect to:

Songs

Versions

Releases

Videos

Expenses
(Tracking only)

2.6 Video from Event

Add a button:

“Create Video for this Event”

Opens Video creation dialog with Event pre-attached

2.7 Unified Task Architecture

Events must allow:

Add Task

AutoTasks (Attend Event)

Custom Tasks
All using standard Task editing.

PHASE 3 — RELEASES SYSTEM OVERHAUL

Has physical copies? (YES/NO)

3.2 Exclusive Availability

Works the same as:

Songs

Versions

Videos

“Exclusive” = YES/NO → Show date fields + notes.

3.3 Release Types

Allowed values:

Album

Deluxe Album

Double Album

EP

Remix EP

3.5 Required Recordings → Tracks Module Overhaul

Rename Required Recordings → Tracks.

Track Selection Rules:

User chooses:

A Song

One or more Versions

Tracks must link directly to Song/Version

Tracks Display:

Tracks are not editable from this screen (except order rearranging)

Each track is clickable:

Opens corresponding Song Edit/More Info Page

Track Info should reflect:

Version progress

AutoTask statuses (Record/Mix/Master/etc.)

Whether track is complete or not

Add ability:

“Add Track from a Different Artist”

That track is treated as a referenced external Item

3.6 Tasks for Releases

Unified Task architecture + AutoTasks:
