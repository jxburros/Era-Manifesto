## 🎉 Documentation Reorganization (Feb 2026)

This documentation structure was reorganized in February 2026 to:
- **Reduce clutter** - Root directory reduced by 90%
- **Improve navigation** - Clear categorical organization
- **Consolidate duplicates** - Single source of truth
- **Archive history** - Preserve but separate historical docs
- **Enhance discoverability** - Easy to find information

For details on the reorganization:
- See [docs/history/documentation-reorganization/](docs/history/documentation-reorganization/)
- See [docs/history/](docs/history/) for archived content
