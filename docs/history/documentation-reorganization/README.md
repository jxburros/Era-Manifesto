# Documentation Reorganization History (February 2026)

This directory contains the planning documents and summaries from the comprehensive documentation reorganization completed in February 2026.

## Overview

In February 2026, Era Manifesto underwent a major documentation overhaul to improve discoverability, organization, and maintainability.

## Results

**Before:**
- 41 markdown files in root directory
- Unclear organization
- Duplicate content across multiple files
- Historical and active docs mixed together
- Poor discoverability (2-5 minutes to find docs)

**After:**
- 6 core files in root directory (85% reduction)
- Clear categorical organization in `docs/`
- Single source of truth (consolidated duplicates)
- Historical docs properly archived
- Fast discoverability (<30 seconds)
