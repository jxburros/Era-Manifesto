# Historical Documentation Archive

This directory contains documentation that is no longer current but has been preserved for historical reference and context.

## Directory Structure

### `/e2e-testing/`
Documentation related to End-to-End (E2E) testing with Playwright. **These tests were replaced by unit tests on February 16, 2026.**

All E2E testing documentation in this directory is deprecated. The project has transitioned to a unit testing approach for better performance and maintainability.

**Key Files:**
- `E2E_DOCS_DEPRECATED.md` - Original deprecation notice
- `E2E_TO_UNIT_MIGRATION.md` - Migration guide from E2E to unit tests
- `E2E_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Historical implementation details
- Other E2E-related guides and checklists

### `/phases/`
Documentation from completed development phases. These files capture major milestones and accomplishments during the project's development.

**Phase Completions:**
- Phase 6 and Phase 7 completion summaries
- Enhancement summaries and implementation details
- Test replacement summaries
- Complete work summaries

## Why Archive?

Rather than deleting historical documentation, we preserve it here for:

1. **Historical Context** - Understanding how the project evolved
2. **Decision History** - Reference for past architectural decisions
3. **Learning** - Insights into what worked and what didn't
4. **Audit Trail** - Complete record of project development
