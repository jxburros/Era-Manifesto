TODO

- Remove Propagate button from Songs
- Create a separate Era/Stage/Tags module
	* Once you have created the module, add it to the bottom of every Item and Task Page
	* We are still having consistency problems, so it will now be a completely separate module that will look EXACTLY the same on every page it shows up on.
- Global Tasks: Adding a Task in this screen should still open the New Task page, not the New Item page.  It is a little different.  Category is the Item.  Global Tasks without a Category are displayed, but wrapped in an unseen "uncategorized" folder
- Make all the menu buttons a little shorter
- Make the Trash and Settings buttons side by side
- The menu should be one long list, no header or footer
- Clicking on Era Manifesto should take you to the Dashboard
