# 🚀 Era Manifesto Usability Implementation Plan

---

## 1. Navigation & Context Retention

- [x] **Implement Route-Backed Navigation** ✅  
  Transition from state-based tabs to URL-addressable routes using React Router.
  *Completed: React Router implemented in App.jsx with routes for all entity types.*

- [x] **Enable Deep-Linking** ✅  
  Ensure primary list and detail views (e.g., `/songs/:id`) are directly accessible via URL.
  *Completed: useRouteSync hook handles deep-linking for all entity types.*

- [x] **Add Breadcrumb Navigation** ✅  
  Implement a "Parent-Child" navigation trail at the top of detail views (e.g., `Song > Version > Task`).
  *Completed: Breadcrumb component added to Components.jsx and integrated into all detail views (Songs, Releases, Events, Expenses, Videos, Tasks).*

- [ ] **Persistence Layer**  
  Ensure scroll positions and unsaved field states are preserved when a user navigates away and returns to a detail view.

---

## 2. Task Management Optimization

- [ ] **(Optional) Contextual Task Visibility**  
  Add a toggle in Settings to enable "Stage-gate" visibility, hiding future tasks (like "Release") until prerequisites (like "Recording") are met.

- [ ] **Custom Project Templates**  
  Create a system for users to define templates (e.g., "Single" vs "EP") to prevent the auto-generation of unnecessary tasks.

- [ ] **Batch Editing Actions**  
  Implement a multi-select "Bulk Actions" bar for list views to change Status, Era, or Stage for multiple tasks at once.

---

## 3. Dashboard & "Today" View Enhancements

- [ ] **Task Source Badges**  
  Add visual indicators (icons or text labels) to tasks in the "Today" view to show their origin (Song, Video, Event, etc.).

- [x] **"Next Best Action" Widget** ✅  
  Create a prominent dashboard component that uses due dates and progress logic to suggest the single most important task for the user to focus on.
  *Completed: Smart widget added to TaskDashboardView that prioritizes tasks by: 1) Overdue tasks, 2) Tasks due today/tomorrow, 3) In-progress tasks, 4) Upcoming tasks, 5) Not started tasks. Shows task details, source, status, due date, and cost.*

- [ ] **Aggregation Unification**  
  Ensure the "Today" view captures upcoming/overdue tasks from all sources, not just global tasks.

---

## 4. Design & Accessibility (Focus Mode)

- [ ] **Enhanced Focus Mode**  
  Expand the existing "Focus Mode" to include standard typography settings (disabling forced uppercase) for better readability of dense data.

- [ ] **Semantic Color Overlays**  
  Integrate Green (Complete) and Red (Overdue) status colors into the brutalist UI borders for instant recognition.

---

## 5. Data Entry Efficiency

- [ ] **Quick-Add Wizards**  
  Implement a simplified creation flow for Songs and Releases that only requires a name/Era to start, deferring detailed metadata.

- [ ] **Inline List Editing**  
  Enable direct editing of task names, dates, and costs within the list/grid views to eliminate unnecessary navigation to detail screens.

---

## 6. System Integrity & Performance

- [ ] **Data Integrity Diagnostics**  
  Add lightweight checks for orphan tasks or invalid statuses to prevent UI errors.

- [ ] **Selector Memoization**  
  Optimize performance for large datasets by memoizing expensive derived data (like total budget calculations).
